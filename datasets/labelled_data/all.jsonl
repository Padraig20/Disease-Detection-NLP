He did receive flu and pneumovax vaccines.  He has had a recent admission last month with progressive dyspnea on exertion. The computed tomography revealed increased ground glass opacity in lower lobes superimposed on pulmonary fibrosis with elevated eosinophils peripherally (12%). A bronchoalveolar lavage was also positive for eosinophils. He was started on high dose steroids (prednisone 60mg) with plan for close outpatient follow up for eosinophilic lung disease. He was discharged on 2-3L nasal canula. He then represented to the emergency department for spontaneous pneumomediastinum of unclear etiology.
