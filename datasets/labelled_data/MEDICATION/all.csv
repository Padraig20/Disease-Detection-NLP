He had been in unusual state of good health at baseline respiratory status (using 4L nasal canula at rest and 6L with exertion) when 3 days prior to admission, he hugged his cousin who has rats for pets and also the heat came up from the basement of his house. He feels that with these two events, his breathing became acutely worse and he is concerned for allergen exposure. He denies any sick contacts, fevers, chills, rhinorrhea. He did receive flu and pneumovax vaccines.  He has had a recent admission last month with progressive dyspnea on exertion. The computed tomography revealed increased ground glass opacity in lower lobes superimposed on pulmonary fibrosis with elevated eosinophils peripherally (12%). A bronchoalveolar lavage was also positive for eosinophils. He was started on high dose steroids (prednisone 60mg) with plan for close outpatient follow up for eosinophilic lung disease. He was discharged on 2-3L nasal canula. He then represented to the emergency department for spontaneous pneumomediastinum of unclear etiology.  On day of current admission, the patient called his pulmonologist complaining of worsening shortness of breath since Saturday. Yesterday he was at pulmonary rehab and desaturated to the 70s on 6L with minimal exertion, and he is currently on 4L nasal canula at rest.  No sick contacts recently. He was asked to go to ED.  In the ED, initial vs were: 98.3, 96, 144/97, 24, 97% 6L NC|O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MEDICATION I-MEDICATION O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MEDICATION O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MEDICATION I-MEDICATION O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MEDICATION I-MEDICATION O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MEDICATION I-MEDICATION O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Mr. [**Known patient lastname 4075**] is a 63 yo man with h/o biphenotypic ALL, now Day + 32    from allogeneic SCT, who presents to clinc with one week of worsening    SOB and two days of a clear productive cough.  The patient states his    SOB occured when lying flat, but not with activity.  Also admitted to    chest pressure which would come and go in his left chest no related to    the SOB.  Sleeps with 3 pillows (no change from baseline), denies PND;    admits to a slight increase in lower extremity edema.  Admits to low    grade fevers to the 99's and crampy abdominal pain.  Denies chills,    night sweats, vomiting, or diarrhea.    Assessment and Plan    Assesment: This is a 63 year-old male with a history of h/o    biphenotypic ALL, now Day + 32 from allogeneic SCT, who presents with    hypoxia, one week of worsening SOB, and two days of productive cough.    Plan:    # Hypoxia: The patient developed acute onset of hypoxia accompanied by    fever and a one day cough with sputum production.  Given that the    patient is about 1 month s/p allogenic SCT the differential is broad    and would include bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia (CMV, flu), and    opportunistic infections including fungal infections.  Patient also has    a history of CMV infection, aspergillus and Leggionare's disease and is on    posaconazole.  His CXR showed an opacification of the left basilar lobe    and also right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia as well as a small    loculated right pleural effusion.  Also in the differential is    noninfectious causes such as PE, CHF, or MI.

A 64 yo F w/PMHx sx for AF, COPD, HTN, hyperlipidemia who initially had    an open ASD repair c/b sternal wound infection and post-operative AF in    [**11-15**] treated with amiodarone. On [**2-20**], she was initially admitted    through the ED with SOB and back pain, and was noted to have atrial    fibrillation with RVR. A CTA demonstrating diffuse LAD and    post-obstructive PNA concerning for malignancy. For her atrial    fibrillation, she was started on diltiazem gtt, for which she was    transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**] for monitoring. The atrial fibrillation was    thought to be in the setting of a post-obstructive pneumonia, for which    she was treated with antibiotics. She was then transferred to the floor    later that same night on metoprolol 50 mg tid. While on the floor, she    had a bronchoscopy performed which showed external compression of her    left mainstem bronchus, and she had a biopsy/FNA performed, which    showed large cell carcinoma. She was then readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**]    yesterday with atrial fibrillation with HR 130s, and was started on a    diltiazem gtt.    .    In the [**Hospital Unit Name 42**], she was started on po diltiazem, which was rapidly    uptitrated to 60 mg qid. She was called out this morning. Tonight, at    8:30 pm, she was noted to have HR 160s, w/EKG c/w AF with RVR, for    which she received metoprolol 5 mg IV x2, followed by diltiazem 10 mg    IV x2 without conversion.

Briefly 79 yo F w/ a h/o CAD s/p RCA stenting BMS to mRCA [**3421**] and pLAD    [**3423**], diastolic CHF (2 pillow orthopnea), 1+ MR, HTN, Hyperlipidemia,    previous smoking history, and atrial fibrillation initially p/w cough,    dyspnea.    .    Briefly, pt's symptoms began [**Month (only) 760**]. At that time pt was admitted    with GI bleed, transfused and discharged without resolution of    symptoms. Furthur workup noted bilateral atrial thrombi and    anticoagulation was reinitiated. CTA did not show PE but was concern    for small peripheral emboli as cause of dyspnea. Pt was had multiple    PFTs, echos, CT scans and CXRs without definitive cause of dyspnea.    Most recent PFTs on [**3432-12-27**] c/w restrictive ventilatory defect and low    DLCO suspicious for interstitial pulmonary process (worsening). She has    been followed by cardiology and pulmonology and is being treated for    dCHF and reactive airway disease.    .    On current admission pt presented with cough, thought to be URI, rather    than worsening of chronic dyspnea.  Current etiology considerations    include CHF vs intrinsic pulmonary disease (infiltrative) vs embolic    disease.    In order to optimize cardic function with atrial kick, pt was    pretreated with Sotolol and underwent TEE and cardioversion of afib on    [**3433-1-11**].  After cardioversion, patient developed junctional HR to 45bpm    with SBPs in 80s.  She was placed on dobutamine and HR increased to 80s    (sinus vs antrial escape rhythm).

This is a 57-year-old gentleman with CLL and large cell transformation. He presented with his disease back in [**10/2119**] with an elevated white count and LDH. He was without any splenomegaly or any cytopenias at that time. He did have some bulky lymphadenopathy. He then completed four cycles of FCR therapy, which he completed back in 09/[**2119**]. He had an excellent response to therapy and was monitored off treatment for approximately two years. He then presented in [**7-/2122**] with a rising white count, approximately 50% lymphocytes, and a mildly elevated LDH. He also had some mild worsening palpable lymphadenopathy. He then received four cycles of PCR, but did not have much in the way of response and his treatment regimen was switched to R-CVP of which he received two cycles. He did again not have a significant response, though continued to have an excellent performance status, and he was ultimately switched to Campath therapy. He did have resolution of his lymphocytosis, and his white count has come down nicely, but did not have much in the way of response in terms of reducing his bulky lymphadenopathy. He then eventually had developed an enlarging left cervical node which was biopsied and was found to have Richter's transformation|O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MEDICATION I-MEDICATION O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MEDICATION O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
41 year old man with history of severe intellectual disability, CHF, epilepsy presenting with facial twitching on the right and generalized shaking in at his NH which required 20 mg valium to cease seizure activity. Per outside medical patient was felt to have focal epilepsy with secondary generalization, likely due to anoxic brain injury at birth, and probably related to the atrophic changes seen on MRI, particularly in the left temporal lobe. The patient first developed seizures at age 13 found by family to have a generalized convulsion. He had a second seizure two years after his first episode. He was maintained on Dilantin and phenobarbital. The patient went 20 years without another seizure. He was recently tapered off Dilantin, and it was felt that perhaps this medication was necessary to maintain him seizure free. The patient had no further events during the hospital course and was back at his baseline at the time of discharge. Full EEG reports are pending at the time of dictation.
