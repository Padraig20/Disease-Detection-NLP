He O
was O
without O

at O
that O

. O
He O
did O
have O
some O

He O
then O
completed O
four O

which O
he O
completed O

He O
had O
an O

was O

approximately O
two O

He O

approximately O
50 O

a O

He O
also O
had O
some O

He O
then O
received O
four O

did O
not O

not O

in O

He O
then O

Per O
outside O
medical O
patient O
was O
felt O
to O

focal O

due O
